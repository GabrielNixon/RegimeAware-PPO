# Financial Analysis Repository

This repository contains a comprehensive financial analysis of asset returns, portfolio optimization, and risk assessment, using historical financial data primarily sourced from "Finance Portfolio 2.csv," provided by Professor Aswath Damodaran of New York University (NYU).

## Dataset Overview

### Finance Portfolio 2.csv

The primary dataset, "Finance Portfolio 2.csv," provided by Professor Aswath Damodaran from NYU, contains historical annual returns for various asset classes, including:

* Equities (e.g., S\&P 500, Small Cap)
* Bonds (e.g., 10-Year Treasury, Baa Corporate)
* Real Estate
* Commodities (e.g., Gold)
* Risk-free assets (e.g., T-Bills)

The dataset spans extensive historical periods, capturing multiple economic cycles and critical financial stress periods (1931, 1974, 1987, 2001, 2008, and 2020), making it particularly suitable for analyzing asset behavior under varied market conditions and for robust portfolio risk management strategies.

### cleaned\_real\_asset\_returns.csv

A cleaned and processed version of the original dataset, optimized for computational analysis. Generated by running the script `cleaned_real_asset_returns.py`, it contains standardized and formatted returns data suitable for analytical tasks.

## Python Scripts

* **`cleaned_real_asset_returns.py`**: Script for cleaning and processing raw data.
* **`sharpe_stress_analysis.py`**: Computes Sharpe ratios for assets during stress and non-stress periods.
* **`rolling_sharpe_analysis.py`**: Calculates rolling Sharpe ratios over 2-, 5-, and 10-year windows.
* **`centered_window_analysis.py`**: Performs Sharpe ratio calculations around stress years using centered windows.
* **`bootstrap_ci.py`**: Generates bootstrap confidence intervals for cumulative returns using Monte Carlo simulations.
* **`resilience_analysis.py`**: Computes resilience scores based on volatility, cumulative return, and CAGR.
* **`pca_resilience.py`**: Applies PCA to derive resilience scores for assets.
* **`portfolio_optimization.py`**: Optimizes asset portfolio based on maximizing Sharpe ratio.
* **`sortino_optimization.py`**: Performs portfolio optimization focusing on maximizing Sortino ratio.
* **`factor_attribution.py`**: Conducts factor attribution analysis using the Fama-French + Momentum factors.
* **`drawdown_analysis.py`**: Calculates the maximum historical drawdown for each asset.
* **`rolling_factor_analysis.py`**: Calculates rolling betas and performs statistical diagnostic tests on factor regression residuals.

## Results

* **`analysis_results.md`**: Summarizes all analysis results clearly in markdown format.
