# Financial Analysis Repository

This repository contains a comprehensive financial analysis of asset returns, portfolio optimization, and risk assessment, using historical financial data primarily sourced from "Finance Portfolio 2.csv," provided by Professor Aswath Damodaran of New York University (NYU).

## Dataset Overview

### Finance Portfolio 2.csv

The primary dataset, "Finance Portfolio 2.csv," provided by Professor Aswath Damodaran from NYU, contains historical annual returns for various asset classes, including:

* Equities (e.g., S&P 500, Small Cap)
* Bonds (e.g., 10-Year Treasury, Baa Corporate)
* Real Estate
* Commodities (e.g., Gold)
* Risk-free assets (e.g., T-Bills)

The dataset spans extensive historical periods, capturing multiple economic cycles and critical financial stress periods (1931, 1974, 1987, 2001, 2008, and 2020), making it particularly suitable for analyzing asset behavior under varied market conditions and for robust portfolio risk management strategies.

### cleaned_real_asset_returns.csv

A cleaned and processed version of the original dataset, optimized for computational analysis. Generated by running the script `cleaned_real_asset_returns.py`, it contains standardized and formatted returns data suitable for analytical tasks.
